Provide a color and colorally will measure the [color difference][color-difference] against a set of well-known definitions and return the name of the closest match. Available as a command-line application, CommonJS and ES module.

## Why

- Consistent color names between projects.
- End the use of non descriptive color names, ie. `color-faded-gray`.
- Measures difference by delta-e (difference perceived by the human eye).
- Over 950 different color definitions.
- Allows input and output in multiple formats.

## Install

Using [npm][npm-install]:

```sh
# Install locally.
$ npm install colorally

# Install globally.
$ npm install --global colorally
```

Using [yarn][yarn-install]:

```sh
# Install locally.
$ yarn add colorally

# Install globally.
$ yarn global add colorally
```

Build from source:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:sQVe/colorally.git
$ cd colorally/
$ npm install && npm run build
```

## Command-line application

You can either install the application, see above, or run it temporarily with `npx colorally`.

```
colorally - Name colors by well-known definitions

USAGE

  colorally [option...] [hex]
  colorally [option...] [red] [green] [blue]

  The hex argument can contain either 3 or 6 digits with an optional leading
  0x or #.

  The red, green and blue arguments may only contain digits.

OPTIONS

  -V, --version            output version number
  -c, --copy               copy definition to clipboard
  -f, --format case        output definition in specified format
  -h, --help               output usage information
  -v, --verbose            provide a more talkative result

  The case argument can be either camel fooBar, constant FOO_BAR, dot foo.bar,
  kebab foo-bar, lower foo bar, pascal  FooBar, snake foo_bar title Foo Bar or
  upper FOO BAR. By default, colorally sets case as title.
